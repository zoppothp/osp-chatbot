# AI Business Model Canvas and Teamwork 
This teamwork continues the work you started during the virtual part of the course during which you have learned about analyzing AI potential in use cases and describing a use case using AI Business canvases.

## Goal for the Week (19.05.2025)
The goal for Campus Week is to develop and demonstrate a generative AI solution that helps users discover information more easily from a large collection of text data owned by an organization. You will apply tools learned during the virtual part of the course, such as chatbots, large language models (LLMs), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to create a practical and valuable solution within a few days.

## Use Case Focus
As a recap, the use case needs to be in the area of applying generative AI for accessing textual information. (Do not consider other kinds of use cases like machine vision or other ML applications.) Think about a use case where value is created for users and the organization when users can discover information more easily from a big collection of text data which is the property of that organization. Now you also need to also consider what data you need for developing and demonstrating such a GenAI use case: you can use information (e.g. web pages) readily available on the Internet or within your home university as data and the body of knowledge from which your users get insights throught the demo solution you will setup.
